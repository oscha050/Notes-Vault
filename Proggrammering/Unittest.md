## Structure
A unittest is built with a few components in a object-oriented way. 
### Test Fixture
A *test fixture* is the preparation needed to perform one or more tests. May involve creating temporary or proxy databases, directories or starting a server process.
### Test Case
A *test case* is one specific unit of testing. It checks for a specific response to a specific set of inputs. Unittest provides a base class, "TestCase", which may be used to create new test cases.
