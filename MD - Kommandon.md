## Structure
### Headings
Use # up to 6 times for heading levels, the more the smaller
### Paragraphs 
Use <"p"> in the beginning of a paragraph and <"/p"> in the end of a paragraph to automatically format it.
Avoid using TAB or spaces in the beginning of a line as it can cause formatting errors
### Line Breaks
Add a line break at any point by using <"br"> (only in HTML can be used in md but a simple return works as well)
## Emphasis
### Bold
Use ** or __ in both ends in markdown for bold text, ** works even in the middle of words, in HTML use <"strong"> in the beginning and <"/strong"> in the end instead
### Italics
Use * or _ in both ends in markdown for italic text, * works even in the middle of words, in HTML use <"em"> in the beginning and <"/em"> in the end instead
### Bold and Italics
Use ***  or any combination of the Bold/Italics alternatives in both ends in markdown for bold and italic text, *** works even in the middle of words, in HTML use <"em"><"strong"> in the beginning and <"/strong"><"/em"> in the end instead
### Blockquotes
Use > for blockqoutes, for multiple paragraph blockquotes include a > on an empty line. For nested blockqoutes use >>. In order to avoid problems use a blank line before and after the blockqoute.
Most other md formatting works in blockqoutes
